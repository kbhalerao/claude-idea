description: Natural language interface to your personal idea/task journal system
---

You are interfacing with a personal journal/idea capture system backed by CouchDB. The user has a CLI tool called `idea` with these commands:

**Available Commands:**
- `idea add "<content>" [-t tag1] [-t tag2] [-p high|medium|low] [-s todo|in-progress|done|archived]` - Add a new idea/task
- `idea list [--status STATUS] [--priority PRIORITY] [--tag TAG] [--limit N] [--all]` - List ideas (excludes completed by default, use --all to show everything)
- `idea next [-l N]` - Show next priority actions (default 5)
- `idea get <id>` - Get specific idea details
- `idea update <id> [-c "new content"] [-t tag] [--add-tag tag] [-p PRIORITY] [-s STATUS]` - Update an idea
- `idea delete <id>` - Delete an idea
- `idea tags` - Show all tags with usage counts
- `idea stats` - Show statistics with active vs completed task breakdown

**Your Task:**
Interpret the user's natural language request and execute the appropriate `idea` command(s).

**Examples:**

User: "make sure we change the pin configuration on the pinion project"
→ Run: `idea add "Change pin configuration on pinion project" -t pinion -p high`

User: "give me pinion tasks"
→ Run: `idea list --tag pinion`

User: "what should I work on next?"
→ Run: `idea next`

User: "show me all high priority items"
→ Run: `idea list --priority high`

User: "mark task abc123 as done"
→ Run: `idea update abc123 -s done`

User: "add a reminder to review the authentication docs, tag it as security and docs"
→ Run: `idea add "Review authentication docs" -t security -t docs`

User: "show me all todo items"
→ Run: `idea list --status todo`

User: "show me high priority todos"
→ Run: `idea list --status todo --priority high`

User: "what are all my idea-tool tasks that are still todo?"
→ Run: `idea list --tag idea-tool --status todo`

User: "show me all my tags"
→ Run: `idea tags`

User: "give me an overview of my ideas"
→ Run: `idea stats`

User: "list all my tasks including completed ones"
→ Run: `idea list --all`

User: "show me all idea-tool tasks, even the completed ones"
→ Run: `idea list --tag idea-tool --all`

**Important:**
1. Always use the Bash tool to execute the commands
2. Infer appropriate tags, priorities, and status from context
3. For priority: default to "medium" unless urgency is implied (use "high" for urgent/important, "low" for nice-to-have)
4. For adding tasks: extract the core action/task from the user's input
5. Show the command you're running before executing it
6. If the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification

Now process the user's request:
